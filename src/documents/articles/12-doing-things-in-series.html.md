We can [run things in parallel](11-doing-things-in-parallel.html), but what if
we want to run things in series? 

Example: read a file, transform it using a transformation service that doesn't 
support streams, then write the transformed file somewhere else.


#### Callbacks

[caolan's async](//github.com/caolan/async) gives us `async.waterfall`

Assuming that 

```js
service.transform = function(string, callback)
```

```js
function transformFile(inPath, outPath, callback) {
	async.waterfall([
		fs.readFile.bind(fs, inPath, 'utf8'),	
		service.transform,
		fs.writeFile.bind(fs, outPath)
	], callback);
}
transformFile(input, output, function(err) {
	if (!err) console.log("All ok!");
})
```

The callback is called with no error and the result of last task after all operations are complete
, or when the first error is encountered.

#### Promises

Thanks to `.then`'s behavior when returning a promise, we can chain async 
operations without any helper tools:

```js
function transformFile(input, output) {
	return fs.readFileAsync(input, 'utf8')
		.then(service.transformAsync)
		.then(fs.writeFileAsync.bind(fs, output)); 
}
transformFile(fileIn, fileOut).done(function() {
	console.log("All ok!");
}, function(err) { 
	console.error(err);
});
```

The resulting promise is fulfilled when all the promises in the chain are
fulfilled or is rejected with an error when the first error is encountered.

## Notes

Admitedly, this code may be a bit hard to follow. Lets write it in a way that 
makes it easier - first, `async.waterfall`

```js
function transformFile(inPath, outPath, done) {
	async.waterfall([
		function(callback) { 
			fs.readFile(inPath, 'utf8', callback); },	
		function(data, callback) { 
			service.transform(data, callback); },
		function(transformed, callback) { 
			fs.writeFile(outPath, transformed, callback); }
	], done);
}
``` 

and also, the promises implementation:

```js
function transformFile(input, output) {
	return fs.readFileAsync(input, 'utf8')
		.then(function(data) {
			return service.transformAsync(data);
		})
		.then(function(transformed) {
			return fs.writeFileAsync(output, transformed)
		}); 
}
```

`async.waterfall()` is pretty cool. It starts by giving us a callback, then
when that callback is called with a result, it passes that result onto the next 
function in the list. But it also passes another callback to that function,
which it can use to pass a result to the 3rd function in the list and so on.

Promises are also pretty cool. As we already know, when we return a promise 
from inside `.then()`, we get a promise for the same value on the outside. We 
can  immediately attach another `.then()` on the outside and continue chaining.

Both of these patterns flatten our code.
